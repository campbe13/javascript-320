# Sample Repo for Javascript

I am using this as a [public test repo](https://github.com/campbe13/javascript-320/)  for using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/github/campbe13/javascript-320/) to  deploy to [github pages](https://campbe13.github.io/javascript-320)

The idea is for teachers to share this repo for course content, sample code, markdown instructions maybe, each push to the repo will deploy sample html/css/js for use by students.   

For use with students I would set it up for merges to master instead of each push? 

## content

* [html css beginner js review](week01)
* [testing travis](tricia.html)

## todo 
1. teacher instructions for using it 
3. maybe replace this (README.md) page with student info  or an index.html ? will it supercede ?
4. limit what is copied to github pages  do I need node_modules ?? test in .gitignore
2. fix the linter I am using, it's too strict
2. try github actions instead 
3. deploy to korra instead
4. try with gitlab ci
