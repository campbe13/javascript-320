# Sample Repo for Javascript

I am using this as a test repo for using Travis CI deploy to [github pages](https://campbe13.github.io/javascript-320)

The idea is for teachers to share this repo for course content, sample code, markdown instructions maybe, each push to the repo will deploy sample html/css/js for use by students. 

## content
* [html css beginner js review](week01)


##todo 
1. instructions for using it 
2. fix the linter I am using, it's too strict
2. try github actions instead 
3. deploy to korra instead
4. try with gitlab ci
